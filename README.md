# Bullet-Hell-Shooter

This repo contains a Bullet Hell Shooter created for the _tc2008b_ course in modeling of multi-agent systems with computer graphics.

The theme chosen for this game is _Figures_. That's the reason why all the sprites are related with geometry and lines _(and because those sprites where the easiest to make)_.

The level of difficulty chosen for this project is: **LEVEL**
